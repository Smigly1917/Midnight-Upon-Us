 POLITICS_RAGHU_PODDAR_DESC:0 "This is Colonel Mao Xun speaking. The People's Republic of China once again asks for your cooperation for a better future for Pakistan and Kashmir. We are here to liberate you. Please cooperate with your local government. Colonel Mao Xun was the great great great grandson of Mao Zedong himself, the founder of the People's Republic of China. He attended the National Defence University, then after graduating he quickly enlisted in the People's Liberation Army. Due to his status as the descendants of Mao Zedong, he quickly accepted and began to climb the rank in the PLA. His first deployment would be in Tibet, where he help brutally suppressed the Lhasa rebellion. Then, he was sent to Taiwan, where he almost gets killed when his convoy gets ambushed by Republican resistance. Then, he was promoted to Shao Xiao (Major) in 2090.As an expert on Guerilla Warfare and Counter-Insurgency, he is sent as an advisor for the Hoxhaist Movement during the Albanian Revolution. Then after a short adventure in Cambodia, He is appointed as the Commanding Officer in charge of the supervision for the Invasion of the Kashmir Region in 2094. At first, he initially thought that he will receive a promotion and finally received the desk work that he dreamed of, and he did receive a promotion, but not with desk work. The MSS managed to obtain evidence of Xun's involvement with the Chongqing Clique. The Central Military Committee, fearing the rise of Maoism decided to exile Xun as far as possible. Mao Xun was then promoted into the rank of Da Xiao (Senior Colonel) and quickly named as the Commander of the Kashmir Military Region. Although Xun happily accepted this appointment in public, he know that he is exiled by the CCP.Xun is now stuck in Kashmir, and the only question in his head is:When do I return home?"
 PAK_Daksh_Mallaya:0 "Daksh Mallaya"
 POLITICS_DAKSH_MALLAYA_DESC:0 "Mallaya never expected that Poddar will end like this. He always expects that fuckers will resign, not being blown off on live television. The money he spent for gathering those evidence, the time he spent pinpointing those evidence towards Poddar's secret daughter, the time he waste to uncover many of Poddar's budget mismanagement and shady deal. All of his efforts, to weaken Poddar and his Mumbai Clique and to finally force him to resign, has been reduced to void. Poddar lays dead, his ashes are spread along the Ganga river. But, at least the evidence he gathered against the President managed to make the President appoint him as the new Prime Minister. The situation right now is not good for Mallaya. In the Parliament, there are rumors that several Member of the Lok Sabha is planning for a motion of no confidence against his Government. In the streets, sectarian conflict increases as various terror attacks occurred across India. Protest demanding the resignation of Mallaya and demanding the end of BJP dominance also has become an everyday sight. Will Malaya be the Prime Minister that will bring unity to India? Or will he be the last Prime Minister of a united India ? Time is ticking Mallayaâ€¦."
