 PAK_Mao_Xun:0 "Mao Xun"
 POLITICS_MAO_XUN_DESC:0 "This is Colonel Mao Xun speaking. The People's Republic of China once again asks for your cooperation for a better future for Pakistan and Kashmir. We are here to liberate you. Please cooperate with your local government. Colonel Mao Xun was the great great great grandson of Mao Zedong himself, the founder of the People's Republic of China. He attended the National Defence University, then after graduating he quickly enlisted in the People's Liberation Army. Due to his status as the descendants of Mao Zedong, he quickly accepted and began to climb the rank in the PLA. His first deployment would be in Tibet, where he help brutally suppressed the Lhasa rebellion. Then, he was sent to Taiwan, where he almost gets killed when his convoy gets ambushed by Republican resistance. Then, he was promoted to Shao Xiao (Major) in 2090.As an expert on Guerilla Warfare and Counter-Insurgency, he is sent as an advisor for the Hoxhaist Movement during the Albanian Revolution. Then after a short adventure in Cambodia, He is appointed as the Commanding Officer in charge of the supervision for the Invasion of the Kashmir Region in 2094. At first, he initially thought that he will receive a promotion and finally received the desk work that he dreamed of, and he did receive a promotion, but not with desk work. The MSS managed to obtain evidence of Xun's involvement with the Chongqing Clique. The Central Military Committee, fearing the rise of Maoism decided to exile Xun as far as possible. Mao Xun was then promoted into the rank of Da Xiao (Senior Colonel) and quickly named as the Commander of the Kashmir Military Region. Although Xun happily accepted this appointment in public, he know that he is exiled by the CCP.Xun is now stuck in Kashmir, and the only question in his head is:When do I return home?"
 PAK_Emrah_Qazi:0 "Emrah Qazi"
 POLITICS_EMRAH_QAZI_DESC:0 "From just an unimportant cadre to be the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan and also the leader of an Independent Pakistan was certainly a very successful accomplishment. Emrah Qazi never suspected that the Chinese will ever pick him up in the first place. For several years, he often regretted his decisions to collaborate with the Chinese. But it seems today that his decision was proven to be fruitful. Of course, he never really like the Chinese. The Revisionist Imperialist was never a friend of Pakistan, and he despised them for that. But still, to achieve a free Pakistan, Emrah will do anything, even if he must work with the Chinese. That is a commitment that Emrah always hold, whatever the cost. The news of Emrah's appointment is very surprising. No one ever suspected that Emrah will be considered for this position, let alone to be picked to the position. His old comrade in hiding accused Emrah as a traitor, but Emrah largely ignored it. They didn't know his real agenda, and Emrah prefer to keep it that way. Now, Emrah stands as the leader of a Free Pakistan. They might be dependent on the Chinese right now, but Emrah will make sure that Pakistan will slowly but surely excise the tight leash that the Chinese hold against Pakistan. Slowly but surely, Pakistan will be the master of his fate."
